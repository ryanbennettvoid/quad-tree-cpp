### Why?
- To experiment with high performance 2D point queries for geolocation software
- To extend my knowlege of Java to C++
- To learn about the C++ ecosystem, e.g. CMake, compilers and cross-platform development
- To strengthen my algorithm intuition
- But mostly as an excuse to use the awesome powers of C++
